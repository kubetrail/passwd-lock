	Short: "Read verify and echo passwd",
	Long: `This is a command that is mainly intended to be used
to populate an environment variable with user passwd in such a way
that it does not get captured in command history.

When you run this command, it will prompt the user to enter
passwd twice, it will then verify that the passwds match,
and it will eventually echo it out.

Use it as follows:
export PASSWD=$(passwd-lock rvep)
`,
